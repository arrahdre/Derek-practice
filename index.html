                <p>I have always had an interest in computers and am trying to find something at Tech 901 that I could see myself developing the skill-set in to make a career from what I've learned here. Web Programming seems interesting so far and I'm excited to be exposed to new things in this class.</p>
                <p>I think my superpower is my patience with people and my willingness to listen patiently.</p>
